# hello-world
Thus begins my development journey in earnest.
I have had many ideas, but my coding experience at age 51 is comprised of a summer class after my 6th grade year just before starting Junior High on a Texas Instruments PC, and a single semester class in High-School my Senior Year (Notre Dame class of 1988) on IBM PC's with 640 K of RAM and Dual 5.25" Floppy Disk Drives (both working working with BASIC). So in reality, I'm pretty much starting from scrach, lol. ;-)
